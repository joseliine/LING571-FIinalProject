Hi me llamo Cindy and I am the host of Do you Spanglish? This podcast is not an informational or an educational podcast this is simply a fun and lighthearted podcast where most of us latinos can relate. I am half Mexican half Salvadorian but I was born and raised in Los Angeles Hollywood to be exact. I remember growing up in a household where my parents enforced the Spanish language but my sister and I spoken English the entire time at school. So you see how my brain can easily mix and match the two languages. Mis amigos tease me because I pretty much speak Spanglish most of the time so Im glad que no soy la unica. Stay tuned for the laughs the memories the chiste and the chisme as I catch up with others who also live their lives in two languages. Stay tuned!
