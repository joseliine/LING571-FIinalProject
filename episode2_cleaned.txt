alright today i am here with melissa and welcome everybody to do you spanglish todays topic is the s word the s word whats the s word cindy are we talking about sex what exactly are we talking about here cuz you said that this was gunna be fun and not embarrassing spanish okay yay el español basically i just wan na talk about spanish because i am a latino who was born and raised in los angeles hollywood literally in the in the heart of hollywood so i remember growing up and always being embarrassed like in middle school and even in high school being embarrassed of just speaking spanish around my friends if my parents came around and spoke to me in spanish i was like ugh and i would answer in english and id be like mom like dad please like english you need to learn english um and you know they were always enforcing the spanish language in the household and they were like aqui solo se habla espanol if youre living under my roof vas a hablar español and now thirty six years later youre grateful im fucking grateful i am very grateful to know el lenguaje el español osea its so helpful in not only the workplace because everyone asks you like oh youre bilingual its an asset right its an asset but not only that also i feel like its the second language now in america in you know the united states yeah yeah its the second language in the united states but it is more more so the first language globally right theres way more spanish speaking countries than there are english speaking countries in the world great so um thats you know spanish obviously spanish to me i mean for those of you who are just learning about me i am born and raised in puerto rico so spanish español es mi primer lenguaje and i am extremely proud of and i mean i think thats the one thing that latinos have right were all very very proud of who we are or where we come from and of what makes us who we are and for me personally spanish is a big part of who i am right its its a part of of of my genetic its a part of my identity its its its very much a part of everything and anything that encompasses the word latina within me not only that pero dont you feel like spanish also is the way we connect yes totalmente tolalmente todos los latinos todos conectamos con el español i mean sometimes ill be like you know i always speak english with work and friends and then i go to like the valet or you know im at a restaurant and the minute i feel and doesnt it feel so nice to be like gracias buenos dias como esta uh huh si de gracias and the minute you speak spanish to another latino they automatically switch automatically you they become your cousin girl theyre like your best friend theyre like oh you know what they take care of you yeah sabe que voy a dejar su carro aquí en frentito aqui pegadito es mas tome llevese la llave ni me la tengo que llevar llevese usted la llave aquí va estar el carro yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly so its like how we connect uh huh so its not only about you know like obviously like speaking two different languages but its a way that latinos connect yes and and you know what cindy its its a beautiful thing that youre bringing up this topic and that youre making the whole episode on this topic because i have encountered in my career as an actor unfortunately other actors who will right now nowadays being latino is very cool right and being latino which one day it wasnt but right now its its the in thing to be right snap snap snap the in thing to be latinos are cool ummm and it it really bothers me when i hear beautiful talented educated people that have so much power amongst them and within their voice and within their name umm say or imply that speaking spanish isnt important and that its not important to call yourself a latino the necessity to learn the language and the necessity to speak the language and for me that hurts on such a deep level and that is is so disappointing because the one the way that i see it and i remember i have a i had a vocal coach when i lived in miami after winning nuestra belleza latina in that they gave me focal neutral accent classes for a whole year and shes argentinian her name is laura moro uh huh and laura moro taught me that the one thing that unifies all hispanic countries is not their culture is not their customs is not the food its the fact that theyre spanish speaking countries and even within the spanish there is theres a lot of difference right because in mexico claro they call the trash can basurero si in puerto rico we call it zafacón in you know theres words that change here and there but aside from the words everybodys gunna understand each other on a general level everybodys gunna understand each other so thats the one singular thing that unifies all hispanic speaking countries is the fact that they speak spanish you know so to make it seem like its not important and to make it seem like its oh no i dont need to speak spanish to be considered a latina makes me cringe a little bit because its like mmm but you do but you do because and and we were talking umm when you when you mentioned this we were talking about this about and latinas right yes yes because you because im technically i consider myself first generation because i am the first generation to be born and raised into this united states of america culture yet in my household it was very latino latino latino i mean my mom cooked mexican food all day every day we never went out to eat except weekends and my dad you know like was salvadoreno so you know i was again first generation you know born and raised into the united states so going to school and friends events in all in english and then coming home to this super latino bubble of like you know spanglishing basically which is different because you mentioned that that your mom didnt allow you right to speak spanish to speak english at home right she enforces spanish and thats something that i also had as an experience when i was a kid because i lived for three years in north carolina which is very southern and very hey yall and all those things and my mom would literally ignore me i could be dying and unless i said whatever i needed to get out in spanish she would mama me estoy muriendo yeah yeah me ignorable por completo al menos que yo le dijera lo que le tenia que decir en español and then when i went back to puerto rico and fourth grade umm so i was first second and third grade in north carolina so when i went back to puerto rico in fourth grade i had to take tutoring for spanish i didnt lose it but i did have to take tutoring in spanish so i could perfect interesting but my english was great great it was very southern but then when i got to the school that i went to which was a fully bilingual school i lost the southern and i was and i ended up with very non accented english or what some people would call non accented because ive also been told that i do have an accent when i speak english i mean i can turn it on and turn it off you know ive i can totally be sofia vergara claro pero ive been told that before too and like second i can be i can be whoever they want me to be but i can also sound like this and be very american and like not you wouldnt even know that you know that my first language was spanish right uh but what i was gunna get to was the fact that like you said youre youre first generation because you were born in the united states but i kind of see that as second generation as far as latina right because because yes you are from from your parents born in the states but your parents are your first generation and you are second generation from that family within the states does that make sense yes it makes sense right so when i hear stories like yours um which not like yours because you were enforced to speak spanish therefore you do know the language its not like yours but of those people that because their parents for whatever reason maybe they were embarrassed they didnt want their kids to get bullied and thats very its very respectable right and its not its not that im judging anybody for it but like if that is the reason that they did not learn spanish as children but they still consider themselves latino i think once you have enough age or once youre able to make that recognition it is on you to take on the responsibility of learning the language but isnt it crazy that like im also now this was like three decades ago right i used to be embarrassed and you know some parents who didnt teach spanish you know to their kids who are latinos back then thought like oh its going to be a disadvantage for them theyre going to get made fun of right and now here we are like i said three decades later and now its such an advantage yeah and every basic job requires or not requires but its an asset it a plus yeah one hundred percent its an asset to any position because again because again theres so many latinos in the united states so to me its kind of like crazy how within three decades so much has changed youve seen it shift ive seen it shift exactly yeah yeah its its such a crazy thing and even in my career im an as an actor i feel that when i get cast right when people get cast because they they are fluent in spanish its also a part of of the under not under underlined description right those little the little the little words at the bottom of the contract that they could potentially and i always think and youre in casting right you work on casting exactly i always think that when you are cast in job hat is set for a person its because they can probably use you to promote the show on univision or they can use you to promote the show like on despierta america el gordo y la flaca which hi to everybody that works there because i was i was there hiiii i worked with them for for years um but they could they could take you to telemundo and to univision and to azteca america and to tv azteca and to all these other networks so you can promote the show in a larger scale and so they can reach that ev every day growing population of latinos within the united states right and again it makes relatable right it takes you back to the people who arent in the business you know the people who are like you know just other latinos who are just happen to be listening who can relate to you right who are like oh melissa habla espanol right es de puerto rico ella nació en puerto rico you know shes dont want to say full latina but when people dont really speak the language its like are you really full latino latina latinx you know yeah are you yeah i agree and i i would be the person to say uh maybe no theyre not and thats very controversial and i understand that because theres a lot of people that say oh being latino is a feeling and yes yes it very much is but i also feel that there is there is a big part of being latino that its just being able to communicate with your people you know and that that is more than a feeling it is it is more than just um a waving of a flag it is its its a culture that its deeper set right its deeper set and if we i mean we can go even further into this until like that would be way too much like into the entertainment industry part of it cuz thats the industry that i you know that im very much involved but thats great cuz this is what youre this is what we are we both are in there yeah you know on the other side its its very funny because i feel like a lot a lot of the times and i remember having a conversation in a room once where there was a lot of big names eva longoria was in that room and and i remembered daring myself to speak up about this because a lot of them havent worked on hispanic tv right and i have and um its its its a its a different perception and when youre in those type of places for example like eva that shes getting to produce and then shes seeing these things that arent necessarily theyre not being successful or theyre not having the amount of seasons that they want them to have or theyre n theyre not being what they intended them to be i remember daring myself be like just melissa just dare it just say it just say it and i did and wha what i said was that unfortunately with latinos although there is a big umbrella right we are all latinos we dont all identify in the same ways we dont all have the same experiences coming to united states right we dont all go through the same struggles and that is a big part of your identity as a latino especially in this nation especially in the united states right especialmente porque were such a melting pot y mucha genie viene de like you said mexi mexico el salvador guatemala puerto rico osea cuba republica dominicana argentina republica dominicana venezuela ecuador theres so many people and like you know another thing that has happened to me is like also i see again like we mentioned before like speaking spanish is such a relatable yeah feeling and experience for with from latino to latino yeah um and ive seen actually other latinos before and ive spoken to them in spanish immediately before they even said a word to me id like oh gracias gracias por abrirme la puerta and theyll respond to me in english mhm and so sometimes i feel like now im a little more cautious of like when i do that of not thinking of not thinking me tiros you know what i mean exactly like shes latina im gunna speak spanish shes speaks spanish and you know i used to do that a lot more back in the day and like until it got to the point where it happened a few times where like i spoke i speak spanish to someone and they responded in english and i was like oh did i just insult them like its really a thing like a lot of latinos again dont speak spanish yeah or they dont want to yeah and i think its so sad because i think you know its one of the one of the beautiful things of just representing your country and representing your culture is so much of it is your language you know i think for example in puerto rico right in puerto rico we are we are born us citizens but we are not a state and i would never want us to be a state because if we were a state we would be another star of the american flag instead of our beautiful on our flag and we would you have your own flag yeah and and we would be we would be uh the language would have to change right because it would be a state and the first language would then have to be english and i could never see puerto rico and and my island my beautiful island in the caribbean losing its language and not being a country country youre right and you know whats funny i tra just like you like you and i both travel a lot yeah weve traveled around the world like that were very blessed and like cheers cheers cheers to that um but yes we are having vino con wait what is this called well okay so this drink that i made cindy today i learned uh on my visit to madrid and its they make it in summer its called tinto de verano and its just its basically if you want to try it at home its basically red wine um some type of sprite or in this case we used fresca fresca and then you can throw some strawberries i have strawberries blueberries and a little bit of lime um in it and its so refreshing delicious its so yummy oh my god cindys had like three glasses already whoo hoo where we are i get the flowing going you know um so like i was saying you and i travel so much around the world and every time i travel to a different country whether its like prague or iceland or namibia or south africa every time i speak spanish with another colleague or friend or sibling it amazes people its like oh my god like what is you speak spanish wow cuz spanish is also its a very romantic language its romantic you know but i think the only place where its not seen as fabulous as glorious as glorious as fantastic it really is as it is here es los estados unidos de america like this is the only place where its like eh spanish and its like around the world its like wow youre from mexico and there is its such a beautiful thing to be and i im telling you this as im looking at my at my adventure world map yes your world map on the wall here its such a beautiful thing to be able to travel to other countries and communicate just communicate there i mean most of south america is spanish speaking countries or portuguese central america is spanish speaking countries the caribbean is spanish speaking countries most of europe a lot of a lot of europe i mean well spain um you know theres theres so many countries around the world where you like its its spanish you know todo todo español español todo its spanish so so i i encourage i encourage highly those people who who love calling themselves latinos and who dont necessarily know the language to you know to to dare yourself to learn it its only going to make you better and its only going to make you a rich or more culturally enhanced right human being you know and i have i have a very good friend of mine which actually really surprised me um one day in class i think you met him at my birthday jake yes um jake is what us us spanish people call one hundred percent gringo gringo osea super like americano super gringo blonde gringo blue eyes osea todo uh huh uh huh el el el el the poster boy el poster boy el gringo the cookie cutter gringo yeah yeah yeah uh but he speaks spanish he can speak spanish and one day he started talking and i was like oh okay okay jake okay you you speak spanish you i mean granted hes not super fluent but he tries you know he tries and he does his very best and thats the beauty of it though and thats so beautiful yeah thats the beauty of it cuando gente actually trata trata de hablar español when they give it the importance that it exactly actually has again at the end of the day its like we speak another language aside from english that in itself is is and and and not just we speak another language aside from english if you know spanish you can understand portuguese and italian italian oh yes very very easily and french you know yo aprendi you can at least pronounce reloj i took french let me just tell yall i took french for five years and i was an a student yes girl porque era lo mismo que español like the conjugation the certain words it was very similar to french so it was very easy for me to pick it up and follow it you know hmm thats thats awesome ive always wanted to learn a language and i started with portuguese and i and this is because i remember when i worked at univision they had me do press junkets for movies univision univision they had me do press junkets for for movies and for shows and i remember for one of those we traveled to brazil and i they they sat me like i from the group of reporters i was one of the only ones that was both fluent in spanish english and they sat me in the passenger seat with the driver right so and the driver was speaking portuguese and super fast and i was whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa but if he if he slowed down enough because they speak very fast same as us sane as the dominicans same as cubans and they drive really fast too yes but if they speak slow enough i could i could understand and if i spoke slow enough in spanish they could understand same with italian italian if we speak slow enough and if they you know like you can get the gist of what theyre saying and they they too can get the gist of what im saying if i speak in spanish but it just you know you like any other thing you have to go slow and you have to take the time to give the person time to accommodate their thoughts to what youre saying right right right and at the you know and its again you know but its a beautiful thing beautiful thing and i mean italian just italian is next on my list by the way italia el italiano its a love laguage te van a enamorar yeah whoo well any any spanish uh i dont know what the base word would be for that but any spanish speaking country or like or the bottom line is is is hispano verdad paises hispanos um is is romance language italian portuguese spanish spanish from spain spanish from any part of the world theyre just very rmeonatic you know so for all you latinos out there who are listening who dont really know how to speak spanish learn it practice it practice makes perfect honestly mm huh like its how get yourselves on duolingo listen duolingo is easy its quick la manzana or el hombre yeah la mujer or you know what i have another turn on univision every morning watch my friends at despierta america there you go carla martinez aleida aleida ortiz eh francisca um who else uh ana patricia left but everyone everyone carlitos calderon and just hear them i think i think thats the best way to learn something is to immerse yourself and if you cant travel to a spanish speaking country then immerse yourself in spanish speaking tv exactly and have it on in the background or listen to a spanglish or listen to a spanglish podcast or listen to a spanglish podcast hey do you spanglish anyway well thank you very very much for being here with me today and you know chatting with me while
