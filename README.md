# LING571-FinalProject

ABSTRACT

Code-switching is a linguistic phenomenon in which bilingual speakers alternate two or more languages or varieties of languages in the same conversational event. It’s most commonly observed in highly bilingual communities. Besides in-person conversation, code-switching has also integrated into our everyday lives across platforms such as podcasts, movies, songs, television, radio, tweets, and even virtual assistant technology.

This purpose of this project is to build a corpus for English and Spanish code-switched discourse from a bilingual podcast titled “Do you Spanglish?” Furthermore, it will identify code-switched utterances among bilingual speakers by using monolingual POS taggers for English and Spanish. Finally, the code-switched instances will be analyzed using the Antconc toolkit to better understand code-switching among bilingual speakers.
